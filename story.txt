Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who recided on a mango tree, which was on the banks of a river. In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day the monkey send some fruits for the crocodile wife. she ate the fruits and liked them, but was jealous as she did'nt like her husband spending time with the monkey.
She told her husband, "If the fruits are so juicy, i wonder how sweet the monkey's heart would be. Get me the heart of the monkey". The crocodile was not willing to kill his
friend but has no choice.
